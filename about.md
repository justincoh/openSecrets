###About This Project
***

>This began as a playground to experiment with [d3] and different APIs in my free time at [Fullstack Academy].
>Then [this] story ran in the news, and curiosity got the best of me.


>Thanks to the OpenSecrets [API], there's a ton of freely available data
>about where political funding originates, and this project was a way for me to visualize it.


I'm testing out a few extensions/improvements at the moment, so check back over the next few weeks.

Also, feel free to fork this from [github] and do your own thing.
