###About This Project

***
>This began as a playground to experiment with [d3] and different APIs in my free time at [Fullstack Academy].
>Then [this] story ran in the news, and curiosity got the best of me.


>Thanks to the OpenSecrets [API], there's a ton of freely available data
>about where political funding originates, and this project was a way for me to visualize it.
>Feel free to show some love on [github] or fork the repo and do your own thing.

2/27/15 Update:
#####Heatmapping is new!  
Unfortunately I can't fully seed the database due to API limitations, but if you want to help fill up the heatmaps go through and click a bunch of representative names!

I'm also working on a different, more helpful hover tooltip for the heatmapped . . . maps.  Check back soon!


3/6/15 Update:


More helpful tooltip implemented!  States now display total funding coming from the selected industry on hover.
