Thanks to the OpenSecrets API, there's a ton of freely available data
about where political funding originates, and this project was a way for me to visualize it.


Currently working on a few additions:
1. State summary by industry, similar to the current representative pages
2. State summary by party
3. Adding an industry heatmap option to the home page where states will be color coded based on the selected industry
