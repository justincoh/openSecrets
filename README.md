####If you're curious where your state's representatives' funding comes from, head over to [openSecrets] and check it out!

Thanks to the OpenSecrets API, there's a ton of freely available data
about where political funding originates, and this project was a way for me to visualize it.





Currently working on a few additions:

1. State summary by industry, similar to the current representative pie chart pages
2. State summary by party

Feel free to show some github love or fork and do your own thing!  
Built primarily on Node, Express, D3 and jquery.
