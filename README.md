This began as a playground to experiment with d3 and different APIs in my free time at Fullstack Academy.

Thanks to the OpenSecrets API, there's a ton of freely available data
about where political funding originates, and this project was a way for me to visualize it.


I'm testing out a few extensions/improvements at the moment, so check back over the next few weeks.
Also, feel free to fork this from and do your own thing.
